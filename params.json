{"name":"Tagregate","body":"#  Tagregate\r\n\r\nTagregate adds helpful Rake tasks to Ruby on Rails applications that use Cucumber tags.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nWe now have a rather extensive Cucumber test suite at HowAboutWe, but even when\r\nit was smaller, it quickly became apparent that the long time it took to run the\r\nentire suite was negatively impacting our development process.\r\n\r\nWhile any sufficiently large Cucumber suite will eventually need more\r\nsubstantial optimizations like parallel execution and fast hardware, a\r\nreasonable first step for us was to begin tagging each new feature with the\r\nareas of the codebase most related to our test. Then for example if we were\r\nreworking the signup page, we could run the @signup tag, get a decent level\r\nof confidence in the regression risk of our change, and only have to wait for a\r\nsubset of our entire Cucumber test suite to finish running.\r\n\r\nEventually we had a considerable number of tags in our suite, so we wrote\r\nTagregate to help us keep them organized and valuable.\r\n\r\n## Included Rake Tasks\r\n```\r\n  rake cucumber:tagregate:count\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrints the name and number of occurrences of all Cucumber tags found in your\r\napplication's features/ directory\r\n\r\n```\r\n  rake cucumber:tagregate:file\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrints the name of each tag, along with each file in which the tag is being used.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  # In your Rails application's Gemfile...\r\n  group :test, :development do\r\n    gem \"tagregate\"\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 HowAboutWe.
